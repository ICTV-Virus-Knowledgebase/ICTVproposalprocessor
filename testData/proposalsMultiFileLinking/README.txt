# link changes across proposal files

---------------
level 1: (done)
---------------

Merged all proposals and ordered actions before executing. 
Resolved creating a genus in one proposal, and adding the species in another.

---------------
Still to do: 
---------------
1. Deal with double-renames, double moves, etc
2. Removing "unexpected lineage" warning, by realizing another proposal changed it from expected. That may require recording all intermediate lineages, to work past one leve. 
3. attribution of empty genera is complicated, and not working well.

Open desing questions:

1. pre-process actions to merge chained actions? or try and figure it out when target/parent lookup fails
