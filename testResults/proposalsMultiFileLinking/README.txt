TO FIX: when a genus is created, then renamed, then some species is added to it's original name, the lookup fails

HACK: in addition to ".otherLineage", track ".otherName" - that will work for 1 change
GENERAL: keep sepearate table of all otherName and otherLineage values for each taxnode_id (much more work)
