Fungal and protist virus (F) proposals	2023.009F	2023.009F.v1.Virophages_reorg.docx	2023.009F.v1.Virophages_reorg.xlsx	Establishing formal demarcation criteria for the Maveriviricetes class (“virophages”), and creating or re-assigning 4 orders, 7 families, 7 genera, and 8 species within this class	Roux S, Yutin N, Fischer M, Schulz F	Simon Roux	Virophages, dsDNA viruses dependent on giant viruses for their replication, were recently reclassified in the Maveriviricetes class, part of the Preplasmiviricota phylum which also includes the related Polintoviricetes and Tectiliviricetes classes. There are currently no clear demarcation criteria to determine whether a new virus belongs to the Maveriviricetes, and classification within this taxon has not been updated since 2015, when the Lavidaviridae family and the two virophage genera (Mavirus and Sputnikvirus) were originally created. Here we leverage a recent analysis of isolate- and metagenome-derived virophage sequences to propose (i) formal delineation criteria for the Maveriviricetes based on the detection of 3 core genes, (ii) updated definition and/or creation for 4 orders, 7 families, 5 genera, and 5 species based on a phylogenomic analysis of all available virophage genomes, and (iii) updated species name for currently recognized virophage species to conform to the Latin binomial format. We also provide bioinformatic resources to help users assign new virophage sequences in this updated framework (https://github.com/simroux/ICTV_VirophageSG).
