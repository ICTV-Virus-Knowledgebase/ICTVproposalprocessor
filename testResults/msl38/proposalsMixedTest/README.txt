Main goal here is not to crash. 

BUG: currently merges the .doc file into an un-related .xlsx as one proposal. EAch should be a separate proposal, since they don't share a "CODE" (ie, filename prefix). 
they're getting merged because there is not "code" so, they're both "1" on their respective lists. Not a big worry.
